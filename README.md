## this is my first try to make a webchat application 
STACK:
- php as backend
- hmtx as ajax calls
- htmx and tialwind as frontend
#### my toughts
was challening to learn new stuf but the choice to not learn laravell , was good as first project because i got do understand what it takes to build it witout.
i had fun , i wll try to make it again with a proper stack ,and publish for everyone to use, a mobile version is my main goal , becuase all the people
i used with did not like to go to the browser all the time and the notification was a major downside.
